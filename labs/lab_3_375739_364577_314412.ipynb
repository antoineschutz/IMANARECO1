    "# Real-World Image Classification in Histopathology (30 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning for classifying histopathology images, despite its capabilities, faces significant challenges. A primary obstacle is its reliance on labeled data, which is often scarce and costly to acquire due to the need for expert annotations. This scarcity can impede model performance, particularly when dealing with uncommon diseases or subtle pathological patterns. Moreover, supervised models may struggle with generalization to unseen data or variations in tissue staining protocols. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will concentrate on constructing classification models tailored for histopathology using the least labeled data possible. Since the lab does not center on computing descriptors for the images, only image features will be provided. Specifically, we utilized [CTransPath](https://github.com/Xiyue-Wang/TransPath), one of the most robust and precise existing image feature extractors in histopathology, as the descriptor. Your focus will be on classifying these features for downstream tasks crucial to histopathological analysis.\n",

    "## Part 1 - Tumor, Stroma Classification in Colorectal Cancer Histopathology (11 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Colorectal cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers affecting both men and women. Accurate diagnosis, supplemented with prognostic and predictive biomarker information, plays a pivotal role in patient monitoring and facilitating personalized treatment approaches. One crucial biomarker is the Tumor/Stroma ratio (TSR) observed in unhealthy colon tissues. This ratio serves as an indicator of cancer invasiveness, with higher ratios correlating to increased invasiveness and, consequently, diminished patient survival probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, pathologists assess the TSR by visually inspecting unhealthy tissue samples under a microscope, relying on their expertise to estimate the ratio. However, given the large volume of samples and the occasional lack of precision in estimations, there arises a pressing need for automated recognition of various tissue types within histological images. The development of a multi-class classifier becomes imperative to accurately identify the diverse tissue types present. Typically, these tissue types include TUMOR, STROMA, LYMPHO (lymphocytes), MUCOSA, COMPLEX (complex stroma), DEBRIS, ADIPOSE, and EMPTY (background).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "<figure>\n",

    "    <figcaption>Fig1: Collection of tissue types in colorectal cancer histology.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, state-of-the-art methodologies in histology have predominantly relied on deep-learning-based supervised learning techniques. However, a significant drawback of such an approach lies in the requirement for access to a meticulously annotated training dataset. Annotating histological data poses considerable challenges—it is a time-consuming process that demands the expertise of pathologists. Moreover, annotators are compelled to label every tissue type, even though only two (TUMOR and STROMA) are of primary interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, we propose an alternative approach. To streamline the annotation process, we task the annotator with labeling only the tissues of interest (TUMOR and STROMA), and discarding the rest. Subsequently, we aim to train a binary classifier capable of automatically recognizing these specific tissues during testing. This novel approach seeks to alleviate the burden of annotation while still enabling accurate identification of the critical tissue types. In this section, we will proceed with implementing and evaluating this proposed methodology."

    "### 1.2 Out-of-Distribution detection with Mahalanobis distance (3.5 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your classifier appears to perform well. However, during testing, it's possible for other tissue types to be present, which cannot be manually filtered out. Moreover, these tissue types may not be recognized by the model as they fall outside the labeled training distribution (It is the consequence of the laziness of the annotators ;)). Therefore, it's crucial to filter out these out-of-distribution (OoD) samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to OoD detection involves computing an OoD-ness score for each test example. This score should be low for in-distribution (ID) examples and high for OoDs. Subsequently, a threshold is defined, for which any example with a greater OoD-ness is discarded, while those below it are forwarded to the model for prediction. An example of an OoD-ness score is the minimum Mahalanobis distance to means."

    "* **Q1 (0.5 pt)**: Why do you think the minimum Mahalanobis distance is a good OoD-ness score?\n",
    "    * **Answer**: As we can see from the graph above the tumor and stroma distributions are clearly distinguishable. If the minimum mahalanobis distance is large it means that the sample falls away from both tumor and stroma distributions and thus should be considered an outlier. Mahalanobis distance is a suitable distance metric for this purpose because it captures the distance from the center of feature distribution and the correlation between distribution points."

We define the `ood_scores` as the minimum Mahalanobis distance from the classifier. Your accuracy results should be the same as before."

    "* **Q4 (2 pts)**: Complete the function `compute_metrics` that computes the recall for TUMOR, STROMA, and OoD examples as well as the average recall over the 3 classes. To do so, you need to consider OoDs as a third class by assigning the prediction `-1` to filtered-out examples based on your threshold. Based on your results, conclude on the feasibility of the proposed pipeline. Propose a solution that would require the least annotation possible but that could significantly increase your OoD recall. Both Tumor and Stroma recall should be above 90%. Recall for OOD should be above 80%.\n",
    "    * **Answer**: the recall for OoD samples is high, so the proposed pipeline is valid and we can propose tho methods to further improve it. For getting higher OoD recall we should minimize the fraction {false OoD negatives/true OoD positives}: \n",
    "    - Firstly, we can just apply lower OoD threshold thus minimizing the number of false OoD negatives. It doesn't require any annotation but more tumor and stroma cells will be classified as OoDs which will negatively affect the tumor and stroma recalls.\n",
    "    - Secondly, train dataset can also contain OoDs which influence the computation of means and covariations. We can find the 5% of \"suspicious\" training samples from both classes which are the most distant from the corresponding means and ask the annotators to re-label them or remove. Then we can recalculate the means and covariations for training data and get more accurate properties of the ground-truth distributions and thus lower number of false OoD negatives."

This motivates us to implement a k-NN classifier for identifying TUMOR and STROMA. Additionally, the k-NN distance serves as a suitable OoD-ness score, aligning well with our task requirements.\n",

We recommend to use `top_k` function from torch ([doc](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.topk.html)). When using k>1, use majority voting to select the winning class.\n",

    "    * **Answer**: KNN and Mahalanobis have the same 92.47% average recall but OoD recall is better for the Mahalanobis distance.\n",
    "    * Mahalanobis distance captures the properties of distributions better than the Euclidean distance used for KNN classifier because it considers the correlation between features in the data. Also Mahalanobis distance is more robust to the \"curse of dimensionality\" which often causes the failure of KNNs. In our data the feature dimension is 768, which is not that large, but the number of samples is also small, so relatively high feature dimension can negatively affect the performance of KNN."

    "## Part 2 - Lung Adenocarcinoma Classification (19 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous exercise, we successfully detected TUMOR and STROMA tissues using a minimum of labels. This allows us to compute the Tumor-Stroma Ratio (TSR), a valuable indicator for determining tumor grade and guiding treatment decisions. However, despite saving annotations, the need for hundreds of tumor/stroma annotations remains prohibitively expensive. Additionally, associating the TSR value with the correct tumor grade and treatment necessitates further algorithmic developments.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach involves annotating entire tumor grades on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and training a classifier directly. However, a significant challenge arises due to the immense size of WSIs, typically containing millions of pixels, which makes direct preprocessing infeasible for computers. To address this challenge, we partition the WSI into thousands of non-overlapping patches. Consequently, each WSI comprises thousands of patch features. However, classifying a conglomerate of features is inherently challenging, especially considering that each WSI may not necessarily contain the same number of patches.\n",
    "\n",
    "As illustrated in Fig. 2, a highly effective method is to apply an aggregation pooling function, which transforms the pool of features into a single slide feature. Subsequently, we can train a simple classifier to classify the slides. In this section, your objective is to develop a classifier and various pooling methods for classifying WSIs of lung adenocarcinoma patterns.\n",

Conversely, solid adenocarcinoma, as illustrated in Fig. 4, appears as solid sheets or nests of cells with little to no glandular differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be working with a subset of the DHMC dataset, comprising 53 acinar examples and 48 solid examples. To assist you, we provide a training set and a validation set, representing 60% and 40% of the data, respectively. In this dataset, features of the patches composing each Whole Slide Image (WSI) have already been extracted using CTransPath. Your initial task is to prepare the data to be suitable for model training.\n",

    "    Average pooling is a good baseline method, but the main disadvantage of method is that it assigns equal weights to all samples, ignoring the importance of instances. Therefore, OOD and non-important instances contribute to the same extent as the key instances. For this reason, the method is also sensitive to outliers. In contrast, attention mechanism, which we implemented below, assigns larger weights to important instances reducing the information loss due to the pooling operation."

This feature is particularly crucial for ensuring the safe deployment of deep learning models, especially in sensitive domains such as the medical field. With an attention layer, it becomes possible to discern the most critical patches that the model considered for a particular decision.

    "* **Q5 (1pt)**: From the visualization above, what can you interpret?\n",
    "    * **Answer**: from the visualization we can see that during classification the attention mechanism gives higher importance to the relatively small number of neighboring batches, forming clusters on the image. The areas, identifying solid patterns, are more homogeneous, have ligher colour and often contain white \"streaks\". The areas, identifying acinar patterns, are less homogeneous in terms of colour and contain tightly packed structures. From our perspective, the discriminative power of the highlighted patches is not obvious but the model receives them in higher resolution and probably extracts the low-level patterns better than we do."
